# Learning React Native  

## Getting Started

Building my first React Native app ever by following [Tyler McGinnis tutorial](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-native-udacity/)


## Technology 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).


### Prerequisites

In order to run the app, you need to download the [expo](https://expo.io/) app on your mobile phone. Once you register with 
them, you connect your phone to your laptop.  

Install the dependencies through Terminal : 

```
npm install 
```

If you have an android mobile you can start the app as follows : 

```
npm run android 
```

### Work in progress 

I am halfway through the tutorial, still missing the following features : 

- Styling 
- Animation 
- Calendar
